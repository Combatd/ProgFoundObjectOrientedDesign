Programming Foundations Object Oriented Design

## Object-Oriented Fundamentals
* In procedural code, the program is written as a long series of operations to execute
  * Some may be organized into functions/subroutines for modularity, but otherwise it goes from A to B
* New programmers start out writing procedural programs, like a cake baking recipe list of steps.
* Object-Oriented Program is split into separate objects
  * Baking might be the mixer, pan, and oven with properties and actions related to it.
* Procedural and Object-Oriented Programming both can descirbe baking a cake, but with OOP, it is reusable.
  * I can use the OOP version to bake muffins due to their similarity, for example.
* Object-Oriented Programming languages are all over, like C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Swift, VB.NET, and more
  * Desktop Applications, web applications, game development, etc.
* Object-Oriented Design makes more sense at scale, with larger programs that require lots of changes.

* Object-Oriented Thinking makes programming represent objects that exist in the real world.
  * A mug, a coffeepot, etc.
  * Every object has properties that maintain its current state
  * Size, weight, color...attributes, properties, state, fields, variables, those are all related terms used by programmers
* An object has nothing to do with its complexity.
 * A cell phone may be complex in the real world, but you can describe certain characteristics
 * Cell phone has behaviors like call, text, etc...
 * Each cell phone would be unique with their own identity as an object
 * Attributes: color, size, weight, brand...
 * Objects can be any sort of noun.
  * Things, people, places, ideas...
