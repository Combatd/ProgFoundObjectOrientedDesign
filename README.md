Programming Foundations Object Oriented Design

## Object-Oriented Fundamentals
* In procedural code, the program is written as a long series of operations to execute
  * Some may be organized into functions/subroutines for modularity, but otherwise it goes from A to B
* New programmers start out writing procedural programs, like a cake baking recipe list of steps.
* Object-Oriented Program is split into separate objects
  * Baking might be the mixer, pan, and oven with properties and actions related to it.
* Procedural and Object-Oriented Programming both can descirbe baking a cake, but with OOP, it is reusable.
  * I can use the OOP version to bake muffins due to their similarity, for example.
* Object-Oriented Programming languages are all over, like C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Swift, VB.NET, and more
  * Desktop Applications, web applications, game development, etc.
* Object-Oriented Design makes more sense at scale, with larger programs that require lots of changes.
